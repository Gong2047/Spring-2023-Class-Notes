### Process-Related System Calls

| **System call** | **Purpose**                    | **Return value on success**                                  | **Return value on failure**                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `getpid()`      | Get process identification.    | PID of the calling process.                                  | It never fails.                                              |
| `fork()`        | Create a child process.        | In the parent: PID of the child.<br />In the child: 0.       | In the parent: **-1** (check `errno`).<br />No child process is created. |
| `exec*()`       | Execute a program.             | It never returns.                                            | **-1** (check `errno`).                                      |
| `wait()`        | Wait for a child to terminate. | PID of the terminated child.(status is stored in the argument.) | **-1** (check `errno`).                                      |

### Exit codes

![image-20230306161730793](./image-20230306161730793.png)

* `echo $?` returns the exit code of the previous program. 

* For the program above, it returns $0$ if succeed

* But you can also return any byte to show the states in the program

## Processes in the kernel

### Kernel-Space Memory vs User-Space Memory

![image-20230306061901411](./image-20230306061901411.png)

#### Task Struct

![image-20230306061924773](./image-20230306061924773.png)

#### Redirect using file descriptors

![image-20230306061953049](./image-20230306061953049.png)

### Shell pipelines

#### Redirect in a shell : `<`, `>`

![image-20230306200551907](./image-20230306200551907.png)

* Output to file

    ![image-20230306200859515](./image-20230306200859515.png)

* input from file

    ![image-20230306200906404](./image-20230306200906404.png)

#### Pipe in a shell: `|`

* Use on <u>two or more</u> program, connecting their input/output together

    * `wc -l` counts the number of lines of the input

    <img src="./image-20230306201300163.png" alt="image-20230306201300163" style="zoom:67%;" />

    * `grep` searches for a pattern

### Process Time

#### User time vs. system time

The <span style='color:red'>**execution of a process**</span> is also divided into two parts.

![image-20230306162730690](./image-20230306162730690.png)

#### The `time` command

![image-20230306162815290](./image-20230306162815290.png)

* the `time` command gives the runtime of the program

## Process-management syscalls in the kernel

### `fork()`

From a programmer’s perspective…

<img src="./image-20230306162907153.png" alt="image-20230306162907153" style="zoom:80%;" />

In the Kernal-space memory....

* Process control blocks before calling `fork()`

    * Process 2436

    ![image-20230306162922305](./image-20230306162922305.png)

* After calling `fork()` a new process is created. Let the PID be 2437

    * A new task struct is created. 
    * Inserted into the double linked list

    ![image-20230306162927963](./image-20230306162927963.png)

In the User-space memory....

* Copy-on-write

    * Not really copied until you actually modify something

    ![image-20230306162933894](./image-20230306162933894.png)

* Another difference is the return value of `fork()`.

* In the parent process, the returned value is the PID of the child

* In the child process, the returned value is 0

    ![image-20230306162939062](./image-20230306162939062-1678154673598-34.png)

#### What happen if two process writes to the same file (Race Condition)

(00:40:00 - )

![image-20230306162956842](./image-20230306162956842.png)

> * Used `fflush()` because writing to a file is fully buffered
> * After printing each line, it randomly chooses to sleep for a second or not
> * `if (pid)` tells if it's the parent process, because if it's the parent process, pid is not 0.
>     * If i'm a parent, I wait until the children terminates. So that I can make sure both parent and child has printed 5 lines



* Run:

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <sys/wait.h>
    
    int main() {
        FILE *fp = fopen("file.txt", "w");
    
        pid_t pid = fork();
    
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
            fprintf(fp, "[%d] %d\n", getpid(), i);
            fflush(fp);
            sleep(rand() % 2);
        }
        fclose(fp);
    
        if (pid)
            wait(NULL);
    }
    ```

* We get

    ```
    [23033] 0
    [23034] 0
    [23033] 1
    [23033] 2
    [23034] 1
    [23034] 2
    [23033] 3
    [23034] 3
    [23033] 4
    [23034] 4
    ```

    * Note that for a single process (like 23033), the number is printed in order

* If we remove the `sleep()` line

    ```
    [23178] 0
    [23178] 1
    [23178] 2
    [23178] 3
    [23178] 4
    [23179] 0
    [23179] 1
    [23179] 2
    [23179] 3
    [23179] 4
    ```

    * This is because the program is too short
        * The scheduler has not get the chance to interrupt the running
        * The parent process runs until it terminates, and the scheduler kicks in and start another process
        * If the program is long enough, the scheduler will come in and interupt your execution and start another process
    * The order of process is not deterministic
        * The scheduler could choose to run the child process immediately after the `fork()`

* If we remove the `wait()`

    ```
    [24222] 0
    [24223] 0
    [24222] 1
    [24222] 2
    [24223] 1
    [24223] 2
    [24222] 3
    [24223] 3
    [24222] 4
    [24223] 4
    ```

    * the program should terminate when the parent process reaches the end of the program 

> This is what we called a **race condition**



### `execve()`

From a programmer’s perspective…

<img src="./image-20230306163018955.png" alt="image-20230306163018955" style="zoom:80%;" />

![image-20230306163038450](./image-20230306163038450.png)

> The task_struct in the kernel space memory is preserved
>
> But in the user-space memory, the entire stuff would be replaced by the new program's code
>
> * The code is changed
> * Allocated memory changed
> * Stack is reset
> * Data is reset
> * CPU registers (Program counter) are also reset

### `wait()` and `waitpid()`

From a programmer’s perspective…

<img src="./image-20230306163058540.png" alt="image-20230306163058540" style="zoom:80%;" />

To understand ` wait()`, we have to look at `exit() ` first…

<img src="./image-20230306163124620.png" alt="image-20230306163124620" style="zoom:80%;" />

> We need a way for **Interprocess Communication**

#### `exit()`

![image-20230306163141614](./image-20230306163141614.png)

![image-20230306163201703](./image-20230306163201703.png)

![image-20230306163205687](./image-20230306163205687.png)

* We shouldn't remove the *task_struct* of the process
    * The parents maybe still waiting for the status, and the exit code.
    * Therefore you need a place to store the status and exit code
        * the *task_struct*
* This is what we called a "**zombie**" state
    * A process that's already terminated 
    * but not yet removed from the kernel data structure

![image-20230306163207633](./image-20230306163207633.png)

> `SIGCHLD` is a **signal** that tells the parents that the child has terminated
>
> This is what we called the **Interprocess Communication**

![image-20230306163215017](./image-20230306163215017.png)

#### Come back to `wait()`



![image-20230306163237071](./image-20230306163237071.png)

#### Case 1: `wait()` <u>before</u> `SIGCHLD `arrives

![image-20230306163405463](./image-20230306163405463.png)

* The *task_struct* has a section called <span style='color:red'>Signal handlers</span>, which executes the signals

    * It's a function pointer

    ![image-20230306163433011](./image-20230306163433011.png)

* When the process calls `wait()`, the kernel sets the process to a <span style='color:tomato'>**blocked**</span> (sleeping) state

    ![image-20230306163435336](./image-20230306163435336.png)

* When `SIGCHLD` arrives, the parent's signal handler(not the original program code) is invoked.

    * executes the stuff pointed by the signal handler

    ![image-20230306163437800](./image-20230306163437800.png)

* Then the signal handler can let the parent process to remove the signal and  destroy the child process

* In this way, the parent process can read the status of the program, and have the exit code of the child process

    ![image-20230306163439766](./image-20230306163439766.png)

* Finally, the signal handler is removed, so the process is once again ignoring SIGCHLD.

* It then returns to the previously-executing original program code in the user space.

* Therefore, it looks as if `wait()` is returned from its invocation.

    * Program code after this `wait()` would be executed

    ![image-20230306163441670](./image-20230306163441670.png)

<img src="./image-20230306163446419.png" alt="image-20230306163446419" style="zoom:80%;" />

* No zombie in this case
* Because the a SIGCHLD is sent to the parent, and the zombie is taken care immediately



#### Case 2: `wait()` <u>after</u> `SIGCHLD `arrives

![image-20230306163457837](./image-20230306163457837.png)

<img src="./image-20230306163528374.png" alt="image-20230306163528374"  />

### Zombies

![image-20230306163631081](./image-20230306163631081.png)

* We didn't do anything in the child process, so it will terminate immediately, before the parent e

* Before calling `wait()`, you can tell that there's a zombie

    * labeled `<defunct>` in the system

* After calling `wait()`, there's no zombie

* **Note**:

    * If the parent never calls `wait()`, the zombie will stay in the system until the parent process terminates
