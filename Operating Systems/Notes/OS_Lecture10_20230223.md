## Recall: race conditions (Data Races)

This scenario is called a <span style='color:red'>**race condition**</span> (or, more specifically, a <span style='color:red'>**data race**</span>). 

The results depend on the <span style='color:red'>**timing** </span>of the execution, i.e., the particular <span style='color:red'>order </span>in which the <span style='color:red'>shared resource</span> is accessed. 

**Race conditions are always bad…** 

* Worse yet, <span style='color:royalblue'>compiler optimizations</span> may generate crazy output if your code has data races. 
* What if you compile the previous code with “<span style='font-family:cursive'>gcc <span style='color:deepskyblue'>-O1</span></span>” and “<span style='font-family:cursive'>gcc <span style='color:deepskyblue'>-O2</span></span>”? 
* To learn more about <span><a style='' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior'>undefined behavior</a></span> (a.k.a. “[nasal demons](http://catb.org/jargon/html/N/nasal-demons.html)”), read [Schrödinger’s Code](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3468263).

Because the computation is <span style='color:red'>**nondeterministic**</span>, debugging is no fun at all.

* [Heisenbug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug): bugs that disappear or change behavior when you try to debug.



### Mutual exclusion

To avoid race conditions, we need **<span style='color:tomato'>mutual exclusion</span>**: 

* If one process is accessing a shared resource, 
* The other processes must be <span style='color:tomato'>**excluded** </span>from accessing the same thing. 

**Note**: <span style='color:red'>race condition</span> is a <span style='color:royalblue'>problem</span>, and <span style='color:red'>mutual exclusion</span> is a <span style='color:royalblue'>requirement to avoid such a problem</span>. 

* However, mutual exclusion may <span style='color:royalblue'>hinder the performance of parallel computations</span>.



## Critical sections

A **<span style='color:red'>critical section</span>** (a.k.a. <span style='color:red'>critical region</span>) is a <span style='color:red'>piece of code</span> that accesses a shared resource.

### Requirements

![image-20230306180156230](./image-20230306180156230.png)

### Attempt #1: disabling interrupts

![image-20230306180205316](./image-20230306180205316.png)

### Attempt #2: using a “lock” variable

![image-20230306180215362](./image-20230306180215362.png)

* **Busy Waiting**
    * The while loop keeps runing and running again. It's also called apinning
* **Priority Inversion Problem**
    * a high-priority process may have to wait for a low-priority process to relinquish resource.

### Attempt #3: strict alternation

![image-20230306180224455](./image-20230306180224455.png)

![image-20230306180426527](./image-20230306180426527.png)

### Attempt #4: Peterson’s algorithm

![image-20230306180436974](./image-20230306180436974.png)

* When the while loop runs, we can wait for the other process. 
* When the while loop breaks, we can do our own work

![image-20230306180448729](./image-20230306180448729.png)

### Attempt #5: spinlocks

![image-20230306180507212](./image-20230306180507212.png)

> **Atomic operation**: The operation does a lot of things and can never be interrupted

![image-20230306180509001](./image-20230306180509001.png)

* We can use the `test_and_set()` to set the `lock` to 1 and check its old value. 
    * If the value is already 1, it means someone else is in critical section, and we have to wait.
    * If it's 0, then we can enter the critical section

> If a scheduler is nonpreeptive, nothing can work

> Priority Inversion problem exists in this solution

#### Attempt #5.1: too much spinning?

![image-20230306180528445](./image-20230306180528445.png)

* When the lock is 1, instead of waiting forever, we can just give up the CPU to others

![image-20230306180524505](./image-20230306180524505.png)



### Attempt #6: semaphores

![image-20230306180546762](./image-20230306180546762.png)

![image-20230306180548678](./image-20230306180548678.png)

> Binary semaphore: the value of it is either 0 or 1

* `up()`
    * If there're more than one process blocked, it can choose any of the process to proceed.
    * there's no specific order

![image-20230306180550757](./image-20230306180550757.png)

* Starvation?
    * Possible

### Summary

* Today we introduced **6 different attempts for critical sections**
* The first three attempts didn't actually work
* **<u>Peterson's algorithm</u>** was a good attempt back in the days, but now it doesn't work anymore
* **<u>Spinlocks</u>** and **<u>Semaphores</u>** are the two approaches that are widely used today
    * **Spinlocks** are mainly used for short critical sections, as it uses busy waiting
    * **Semaphores** put the processes to the block state instead of busy waiting, so that it doesn't waste CPU power
