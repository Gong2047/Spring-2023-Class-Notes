| System call                  | Purpose                                                      | Return value on success                                 | Return value on failure                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

### `Fork()`

![image-20230306170023957](./image-20230306170023957.png)

* `fork()` returns the PID of the child to the parent process, and returns 0 to the chold process

![image-20230306170025795](./image-20230306170025795.png)

**NOTE:**

* For this execution, the order of the last two printed lines can be switched

    <img src="./image-20230307183404254.png" alt="image-20230307183404254" style="zoom:70%;" />

* For this program, there're 4 lines printed.

    <img src="./image-20230307183626519.png" alt="image-20230307183626519" style="zoom:67%;" />

    <img src="./image-20230307183650641.png" alt="image-20230307183650641" style="zoom: 50%;" />

    <img src="./image-20230307183652824.png" alt="image-20230307183652824" style="zoom:50%;" />

    * This is because it's output to a file, and a file outpt stream is fully buffered. 

    * When `fork()`is called, the buffer has not been flushed, so it's inherited by the child.

    * Both process flushes the buffer when they terminates.

* You can also change the default buffering strategy

    * Using the library function `setvbuf ()`

## Process Organization

### Booting the computer

![image-20230306170112463](./image-20230306170112463.png)

#### BIOS: Basic input/output system

![image-20230306170134051](./image-20230306170134051.png)

#### Boot device

![image-20230306170227795](./image-20230306170227795.png)

* boot sector is the very first sector on the disk.

#### Boot loader

![image-20230306170242237](./image-20230306170242237.png)

### The first process - `init` (Linux)

![image-20230306170309901](./image-20230306170309901.png)

* Why do we want `init`, the parent of all other processes?

### Orphans

![image-20230306170332590](./image-20230306170332590.png)

![image-20230306170354453](./image-20230306170354453.png)

#### Reparenting

* the `init` process will adopt all the orphans

![image-20230306170406169](./image-20230306170406169.png)

> In the program above, the child sleep for 2 secs between the line printed, and the parent sleep for 1 second and then terminates. 
>
> This means that before the parent terminated, the child has already print out a line, and it prints the second line after the parent terminates.
>
> From the output, we can see that it's not the grandparents that has adopted the orphan. It's the `init` process that adopted the orphan.

#### What happens in the kernel?

![image-20230306170445673](./image-20230306170445673.png)

![image-20230306170447552](./image-20230306170447552.png)

> The grey pointers remains as the zombie process is not yet removed.

#### Will `init `clear the zombie?

![image-20230306170502526](./image-20230306170502526.png)

> The `init` process adopted the orphans. Now it has two children.

#### How does `init `clear the zombie?

![image-20230306170549660](./image-20230306170549660.png)

**Left:** We can make an infinite loop, and continously call `waitpid()` to clear all the zombies

* Nice try, but it won't work. 

* `init` would be blocked if it calls `waitpid()`, but we can't let it to be blocked. 
* The `init` process is not just for clearing the zombies, it has many other useful works to do.

**Right**: We can overwrite the signal handler, let the signal handler of `SIGCHLD` to call `waitpid()`

* In this way, the `init` process will not be blocked.
* Whenever there's a `SIGCHLD`, the signal handler will call the `waitpid()` and clear the zombie.
* Now the `init` won't be blocked and can do other work

### Some observations

**Processes in Linux are organized as <span style='color:tomato'>a single tree</span>.**

* Why not a forest? 
* Windows does maintain a forest-like process hierarchy, but we‚Äôll focus on Unix/Linux in this course. 

**Reparenting allows processes to run <span style='color:tomato'>without a parent shell</span>.**

* Therefore, **<span style='color:tomato'>background jobs</span>** can survive even after the shell exits.

## Process scheduling

### What and Why 

Computers often do several things **<span style='color:royalblue'>concurrently</span>**, even if it has only one CPU. ‚Ä¢ 

* It‚Äôs called **<span style='color:tomato'>multiprogramming</span>**. 

The CPU <span style='color:royalblue'>**switches** </span>from process to process quickly, running each for a few *ms*. 

* It‚Äôs called **<span style='color:tomato'>multitasking</span>**. 

The OS needs to <span style='color:royalblue'>**choose** </span>which process to run next. 

* It‚Äôs called **<span style='color:tomato'>scheduling</span>**. 
* The part of the OS that makes the choice is called the **<span style='color:tomato'>scheduler</span>**.

### Process states

![image-20230306171006560](./image-20230306171006560.png)

#### Ready

![image-20230306171030222](./image-20230306171030222.png)

#### Running

![image-20230306171038205](./image-20230306171038205.png)

#### Blocked

![image-20230306171058142](./image-20230306171058142.png)

![image-20230306171104340](./image-20230306171104340.png)

> This is very rare

#### Zombie

### Context switching

![image-20230306171134831](./image-20230306171134831.png)

![image-20230306171156795](./image-20230306171156795.png)

> * The best place to store these register data is our <span style='color:tomato'>**task_struct**</span>
> * During context-switching, those register values are all saved to the task_struct
> * **Context**:
>     * <u>User-space memory</u>
>     * <u>Register values</u>
>     * because you need to switch the user-space memory and the register values between different contexts

## Homework

### Question 1

<img src="./image-20230307210203602.png" alt="image-20230307210203602" style="zoom:80%;" />

![image-20230307210423833](./image-20230307210423833.png)

* Note that in this stack, everything above the result is removed after the function `add()` is returned.
* However, the result points to somewwhere inside the removed stack.
    * will cause an <span style='color:tomato'>**undefined behavior**</span>!
    * The compiler would be able to generat any code they want

### Undefined behavior
