## Why operating system?

* In Computer Science, there're several different field of researches, like algorithms, computing, ai, machine learning etc.
* We are those who work on the systems. System basically means the architecture of the computer, like the hardware. 
* Basically, we do the stuff that can support the high-level applications
* If you don't know how operating systems work, you can barely write any efficient code.
* Most challenging course in computer science curriculum since it's not intuitive



## What we'll learn?

This is an **introductory** course in <u>operating systems (OS)</u>. 

We will focus on the **high-level** **design** of **key OS concepts**, such asâ€¦ 

- Process scheduling and synchronization; 
- Deadlocks and their prevention; 
- I/O and file systems; 
- Memory management, including (demand) paging and segmentation; 
- Security and protection (if we have time).
