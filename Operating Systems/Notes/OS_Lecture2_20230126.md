# OS Lecture 2: Introduction

[TOC]

## What is an Operating System

>  We will answer it later

### Where does the OS fit in?

* The <span style = 'color:red;font-weight:bold'>Operating System</span> lies between the user and the computer hardware

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230302191939376.png" alt="image-20230302191939376" style="zoom:65%;" />

* It turns ugly hardware interface into beautiful abstractions

* allows users not to deal with the hardware directly

* **Example**:

    * The OS <span style='color:royalblue'>hides the mechanics</span> of the hard disk away from you. On the other hand, it lets you manipulate <span style='color:royalblue'>files</span>
    * You Don't have to worry about how the file is stored and how to locate it.

### Users are NOT dealing with the OS directly

*  In fact, The users are not dealing with the Operating System directly.

* They deal with <span style='color:red;font-weight:bold'>processes</span>, which are <span style='color:blue'>running images </span>of a program.

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230302211014019.png" alt="image-20230302211014019" style="zoom:40%;" />

    > A program is something you write. After being compiled you can run it. 
    >
    > But you are not running the program itself. 
    >
    > You are running the **processes**.

* **Example**:

    * You have only one copy of “Google Chrome,” but you can open multiple windows at the same time, using the same program file.



* All programs that you run behave as processes. 
* You need processes to access files, browse the web, watch videos, play games, etc.
* In this class, we will talk a lot about the process lifecycle, process management, and other process-related issues in this course.



## How users interact with the OS

* How do the interactions happen between these components?

* Ex: When the user enters `ls`, which process is running?

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230302212434624.png" alt="image-20230302212434624" style="zoom:33%;" />

    > `ls` gives you the list of all the files in the current working directory.

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230302211959158.png" alt="image-20230302211959158" style="zoom:80%;" />

* And the OS need to know how to react to the command: how to requests for the file, and how to list all the files.

### Example: Shell

* **Step 1**

    * Most commands you type in the <span style='color:blue'>shell</span> will start a new <span style='color:red'>**process**</span>

        <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304152030714.png" alt="image-20230304152030714" style="zoom: 60%;" />

        > The **shell** is an environment, which will run when you type a command

* **Step 2**

    * The <span style='color:blue'>operating system</span> contains code that is needed to work with the file system. 

    * Such code in the OS is called the <span style='color:red'>**kernel**</span>.

        <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304152114884.png" alt="image-20230304152114884" style="zoom:67%;" />

        > The operating system contains several "modules" or components. Like the file system module, which handles things with the file system. 
        >
        > These modules are called the "kernel", which is the most important part of the operating system. 
        >
        > It contains all the code and a bunch of data structures in order to run the system.

* **Step 3**

    * The <span style='color:red'>file system</span> module inside the operating system knows how to work with devices, using <span style='color:blue'>device drivers</span>.

        <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304152133275.png" alt="image-20230304152133275" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* **Step 4**

    * Of course, the operating system will allocate <span style='color:red'>memory </span>for the results.

        <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304152158321.png" alt="image-20230304152158321" style="zoom:67%;" />

        > There's another module called the memory management module, which handles the memory related issues.

* **Step 5**

    * The <span style='color:red'>memory management</span> subsystem will copy the result to the memory of the process.

        <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304152237269.png" alt="image-20230304152237269" style="zoom:67%;" />

    

### The real-life interactions for different users

* **In general**

    ![image-20230304164342287](./images/lecture2/image-20230304164342287.png)

* **For <u>ordinary users</u>**

    * The OS is just something that can run programs for them. 
    * They don’t even need to know what a process is. 
    * …unless they need to kill the “Google Chrome” process when it freezes

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304164627549.png" alt="image-20230304164627549" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* **For <u>software engineers</u>**

    * The OS is a piece of software that allows them to interact with the user, the hardware, or even the OS itself, using <span style='color:red'>system calls</span>.

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304164744745.png" alt="image-20230304164744745" style="zoom:67%;" />

* **For <u>hardware engineers</u>**

    * The OS is a piece of software that allows them to host <span style='color:blue'>device drivers</span>. 
    * How does the computer handle <span style='color:red'>I/O (input and output)</span>? 
    * What happens when the user types a key on the keyboard?

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304165036419.png" alt="image-20230304165036419" style="zoom:67%;" />



## Background: Computer Architecture

### What happens when the user types a key on the keyboard?

* Originally, the CPU is executing some program code. 

    * The CPU has a register called the <span style='color:red'>program counter</span> that points to the <span style='color:blue'>next instruction</span> to be executed

        > With one CPU and one core, it can only run one instructions at one time

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304174322163.png" alt="image-20230304174322163" style="zoom:67%;" />

* Suddenly, someone types a key on the keyboard. 

    * This generates a <span style='color:red'>**hardware interrupt**</span>, which requests the CPU to interrupt the currently executing code (when permitted). 
    * …so that the keyboard event can be processed in a timely manner.

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304174432463.png" alt="image-20230304174432463" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* Each kind of interrupt has a unique <span style='color:red'>interrupt number</span>. 

    * There are many kinds of interrupts.
    * The <span style='color:red'>interrupt vector</span> is an array of addresses pointing to each <span style='color:red'>interrupt handler</span>.

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304174626037.png" alt="image-20230304174626037" style="zoom:67%;" />

* The CPU <span style='color:red'>transfers control</span> to the interrupt handler. 

    * The interrupt handler processes the interrupt

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304174630419.png" alt="image-20230304174630419" style="zoom:67%;" />

* Finally, the interrupt handler <span style='color:red'>returns </span>control to the original code.

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304174637154.png" alt="image-20230304174637154" style="zoom:67%;" />

> If you press multiple keys at the same time, the keyboard will let the keyboard interrupt handler know that you pressed multiple keys, and the interrupt handler will let the OS know about it.

![image-20230304175057915](./images/lecture2/image-20230304175057915.png)

## System Calls

It’s similar to an ordinary function call, but with an important distinction...

* A **system call**’s implementation is **inside the <span style='color:red'>OS kernel</span>**

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304175143106.png" alt="image-20230304175143106" style="zoom:67%;" />

* By calling it, it will "**trap**" into the OS kernel

### Example: `time()`

> The kernel is not an process. It's just some pieces of code.
>
> Your process will call those code in the kernel, and the kernel will run. 
>
> But when it returns, the kernel is not really running anything.

<img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304175226649.png" alt="image-20230304175226649" style="zoom: 80%;" />

<img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304175250177.png" alt="image-20230304175250177" style="zoom: 75%;" />



### What is a system call?

* **System calls** are the <span style='color:red'>**programming interface** </span>between **processes** and the **OS kernel**. 

* They are usually <span style='color:blue'>primitive</span> and <span style='color:blue'>fundamental</span>. 

    * For example, the `time()` system call tells you what time it is. 

* <u>What system calls should the OS provide?</u> 

    * Process control
    * File management
    * Device management
    * Information maintenance
    * Communications
    * Protection

* The <span style='color:royalblue'>POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)</span> standardizes some common system calls.

    

### How do we know if some function is a system call?

In Linux System, use `man syscalls` to get a manual of basic system calls

![image-20230304182015499](./images/lecture2/image-20230304182015499.png)

Let’s guess: which of the following are system calls?

* `abs() `
* `fopen()` 
* `fread() `
* `malloc() `
* `memcpy() `
* `printf()`

In fact - **NONE** of them are system calls!

### vs Library Function Calls

If those are not system calls, what are they? 

* They are just ordinary function calls. 

* Those functions are <u>implemented in some <span style='color:blue'>**libraries**</span></u> (not the <span style='color:red'>OS kernel</span>). 

* Library functions are usually compiled and packed inside a <span style='color:blue'>**library file**</span>.

    * Linux:  <span style='color:blue;font-family:Consolas'>*.so</span>— shared object.
    * macOS: <span style='color:blue;font-family:Consolas'>*.dylib</span> — dynamic library. 
    * Windows: <span style='color:blue;font-family:Consolas'>*.dll</span> — dynamic-link library.

* Example:

    * <span style='color:blue;font-family:Consolas'>fopen()</span> is a <u>library function</u> that invokes the <u>system call</u> <span style='color:red;font-family:Consolas'>open()</span>.

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230304195745965.png" alt="image-20230304195745965" style="zoom:77%;" />

    > The **Standard C Library** contains all the standard functions defined by the C standard.

* Why do people reinvent the wheel? 
    * Because system calls are often too primitive and not programmer-friendly. 
    * Compare the following two calls… 
        * <span style='color:red;font-family:Consolas'>open("file.txt", O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR)</span>; 
        * <span style='color:blue;font-family:consolas'>fopen("file.txt", "w")</span>;
    * As a programmer, which do you prefer?

## Two Modes of Operation

### Kernel mode vs. User mode

* The CPU has (at least) two separate modes of operation. 
* The OS runs in <span style='color:red'>**kernel mode**</span> (a.k.a. <span style='color:red'>privileged mode</span>).
    * It has complete access to all the hardware and can execute any instruction. 
* All other programs run in <span style='color:blue'>**user mode**</span>. 
    * Only a subset of the machine instructions is available. 
    * Cannot affect control of the machine. 
    * Cannot do I/O.

### Example: `fopen()`

![image-20230304202451953](./images/lecture2/image-20230304202451953.png)

![image-20230304202508968](./images/lecture2/image-20230304202508968.png)

> After we return from trap, we <u>already have</u> the results stored in the **memory**
>
> So what's returned by the `open()` system call is a **file descriptor**
>
> * It's **primitive** and has only **one integer number**
> * Basically an <u>index</u>
> * It's a way to tell the process how to access the file
>
> the `fopen()` function call will wrap the **file descriptor**  
>
> * into a **<u>file pointer</u>**
> * It'll be returned to the user 



## So, What is an operating system? 

* A piece of software from two viewpoints 

* **Top-down view:** 
    * OS is an <span style='color:red'>**extended machine**</span>. 
    * It provides a clean abstraction for processes to access the machine. 
* **Bottom-up view:** 
    * OS is a <span style='color:red'>**resource manager**</span>.  
    * It manages all parts of the system efficiently. 

* We will discuss the details of the OS design throughout this course

    </div>
</div>    







## Processes

* Let’s consider the following two commands… 

    * `ls`

    * `ls /`

* What are their <u>similarities</u>? 
    * Both use the program file `/bin/ls`. 

* What are their <u>differences</u>? 

    * The program arguments are different. 

    * The processes’ internal states (e.g., running time) are different.

      

### Process ≠ program

* A **process** is an <span style='color:red'>**execution instance**</span> of a program. 

    * Multiple processes can execute the same program code. 

    * A process is <span style='color:blue'>not bounded to execute just one program</span>! 

* A process is an <span style='color:red'>**active**</span> entity. 

    * It maintains <span style='color:red'>local states</span> about the execution… 
        * Which CPU core is it running on?
        * What is the next instruction to be executed? 
        * ...

    * The local states change over time.



### The Shell: UNIX command interpreter

* The **shell** is not part of the OS, but an important program shipped with the OS. 

* When you log in, a shell is started up.
    * It is a place that creates **processes**. 
    * If you enter a command, the shell will **execute** it for you

* **Example**:

    * When you enter `ls`

        * The <span style='color:red'>shell </span>is the <span style='color:red'>parent process</span>. 
        * The <span style='color:red'>shell </span><span style='color:mediumseagreen'>creates</span> a <span style='color:royalblue'>child process</span>. 
        * The <span style='color:royalblue'>child process</span> <span style='color:mediumseagreen'>executes</span> `ls`.

        <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230306041129869.png" alt="image-20230306041129869" style="zoom:67%;" />

### Process hierarchy

>  A.k.a. Process Tree

* The shell itself has its parent. 

* Also, child processes can have their own children. 

* Therefore, all processes form a <span style='color:red'>process tree</span>.

<img src="./image-20230306041853371.png" alt="image-20230306041853371" style="zoom: 40%;" />

### The `ps` command: Show process information

* The `ps` command can display information about every process in the system.

![image-20230306031645017](./images/lecture2/image-20230306031645017.png)

    * How to write a shell yourself? → Lab 2 

* **Process lifecycle and scheduling**

    * How to create processes?

    * How to handle the death of processes?

    * What happens if you press *Ctrl-C*? Can you change this behavior? 

* **Process synchronization and deadlocks**
    * How can processes communicate with one another and cooperate to do useful work? → Lab 3





## Files

![image-20230306032144993](./images/lecture2/image-20230306032144993.png)

### What is a file? What is a File System?

* A <span style='color:red'>**file**</span> is a logical unit of information created by a process.
    * Think of it as an array of bytes, each of which you can read or write.
* A <span style='color:red'>**file system (FS)**</span> is how the OS utilizes the storage device to manage files.
    * <u>NTFS</u> - Default file system on Windows
    * <u>APFS</u> - Default file system on MacOS
    * <u>ext4</u> - Default file system on Linux
    * <u>FAT32</u> - Previous Version of NTFS
* A file system maintains <span style='color:blue'>files</span>, <span style='color:blue'>directories</span>, <span style='color:blue'>allocated space</span>, and <span style='color:blue'>free space</span>. 
* A file system is <span style='color:red'>independent </span>of the OS. An OS can support multiple file systems.

### File Systems

There are two viewpoints:

* **Static view** 

    * How to store files on the disk? 

* **Dynamic view**

    * How to support the operations that update the files? 

        

![image-20230306032620683](./images/lecture2/image-20230306032620683.png)

### What will we learn

    * How to manipulate files and directories? 
* **File system implementation**
    * How are some famous file systems implemented? 
    * Why is my file system becoming slow? 
    * How to recover a deleted file? Why doesn’t it always work? → Lab 4 
    * Why is my file lost even if my disk is physically ok? 
* **Disks** 
    * What’s inside a hard disk drive? 
    * Can you use multiple disks together to improve performance, reliability, or both?



##  Memory management

![image-20230306032844188](./images/lecture2/image-20230306032844188.png)

### Memory Hierarchy

**What happens when you run a program?**

* The program is loaded from <span style='color:royalblue'>hard disk</span> to <span style='color:lightseagreen'>main memory</span>. 
* During execution, instructions are fetched from <span style='color:lightseagreen'>main memory</span> to <span style='color:limegreen'>CPU</span>. 
* There may be 100+ processes running “at the same time,” but only a few CPUs/ cores. How can it happen?

<img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230306033240073.png" alt="image-20230306033240073" style="zoom: 67%;" />

<img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230306033328791.png" alt="image-20230306033328791" style="zoom:67%;" />

### A Process's Memory

* What does a process need to store?

![image-20230306033410631](./images/lecture2/image-20230306033410631.png)

![image-20230306033430392](./images/lecture2/image-20230306033430392.png)



### Why using C?

* **Real operating systems are virtually always written in C.**

    ![image-20230306033533895](./images/lecture2/image-20230306033533895.png)

* C was invented for developing Unix. It’s <span style='color:red'>powerful</span>, <span style='color:red'>efficient</span>, and <span style='color:red'>predictable</span>. 

* On the flip side, you must take care of memory management, e.g., 

    * Use `malloc()` and `free()` properly. 
    * Initialize the memory before using it. 
    * Be careful about the <span style='color:blue'>bounds</span>. 

* → Lab 1

    <img src="./images/lecture2/image-20230306033711172.png" alt="image-20230306033711172" style="zoom:67%;" />

### What will we learn

* **Memory-related functions and syscalls**
    * Why does my program segfault?
    * My program does not segfault. Does that mean I’m managing memory correctly?
    * How to write malloc() yourself using system calls? 
* **Virtual memory**
    * My computer has only 8GB memory, but my processes take way more memory. How can that happen? 
    * Why does my computer sometimes feel slow? 
    * How can multiple processes share memory?



## Security and Protection

The OS needs to <span style='color:red'>control the access</span> of processes or users <span style='color:red'>to the resources</span> defined by the system. 

It must provide means to… 

* <span style='color:blue'>Specify</span> the controls to be imposed. 
* <span style='color:blue'>Enforce</span> the controls. 

Have you heard of the following <span style='color:red'>attacks</span>? 

* Viruses, worms, denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, identity theft, theft of service, …

### What will we learn?

* **Protection-related functions and syscalls** 
    * How does the OS control access to resources? 
    * What do file permissions mean? 
* **Security best practices** 
    * How to store and verify the user password? 
* **Hacking** 
    * How to gain the root privilege legally and illegally? 
    * How to protect yourself from being hacked?
