### Goal of Class

* Overview of the field of Natural Language Processing
    * Evaluation based on midterm and long & short homework assignments 
* Work on a Longer Term Project with a Paper 
    * Evaluation based on Final Projects (and long homework assignments) 
    * Wider implications: conference papers, CV, grad school; job applications

### Grading

* 30% Long HW + 30%Midterm + 5% Short HW + 35% Final Project

* Long Homework – 6 Assignments (1st half of semester)
    * 1 annotation assignment & 4 shared tasks submitted through Gradescope
    * 1 Final project proposal (submitted through Brightspace)
* Short Homework: 
    * based on Assigned Readings & Lectures for second ½ Semester 

#### Midterm

* paper and pen/pencil test in class
* covers Lectures, Reading Material and HW for the first ½ Semester 

#### Final Project

* All final projects will be done by 3 or 4 student teams

* Details on Final Project Website 
* A paper supported by experiments 
    * A program that performs a task and scored against an answer key. Discuss task, methods, evaluation, previous work, etc. 
    * Annotation defining a task. Similar to program option. Evaluate for annotator consistency 
    * Evaluation of Systems – Papers about evaluation metrics, differences between systems, etc.
* Sample Topics 
    * https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring23/CSCI-UA.0480-057/final_project_info.html#Topics 
    * Slides for lectures include related final project descriptions
* Opportunities for feedback before final draft is due 
    * Final Project Proposal: Counts as 1 homework 
    * 30 Second Progress Reports 
    * First Draft (Optional) 
    * Short Talks 
    * Regular meetings with TA mentors 
* Will be evaluated based on written report (unusual for undergraduate STEM class)

## Linguistic Data Consortium 

* Their catalog: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ 
* They have data which may be useful for your final project and NYU has a license 
* If you need LDC data, contact me or the nyu library (this is a relatively new thing) 
    * If you are logged in to the library, try this link: https://catalog-ldc-upenn-edu.proxy.library.nyu.edu/ 
* LDC has different types of corpora (text), some of it manually annotated. 
    * Some data is already available elsewhere: freely downloadable or via the class Resources page
